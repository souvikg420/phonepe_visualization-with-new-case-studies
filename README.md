 The dynamics of transactions, user engagement, and insurance-related data is crucial for improving services and targeting users effectively. This project aims to analyze and visualize aggregated values of payment categories, create maps for total values at state and district levels, and identify top-performing states, districts, and pin codes.
The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves:
1. Decoding Transaction Dynamics on PhonePe
Scenario
PhonePe, a leading digital payments platform, has recently identified significant variations in transaction behavior across states, quarters, and payment categories. While some regions and transaction types demonstrate consistent growth, others show stagnation or decline. The leadership team seeks a deeper understanding of these patterns to drive targeted business strategies.



2. Device Dominance and User Engagement Analysis
Scenario
PhonePe aims to enhance user engagement and improve app performance by understanding user preferences across different device brands. The data reveals the number of registered users and app opens, segmented by device brands, regions, and time periods. However, trends in device usage vary significantly across regions, and some devices are disproportionately underutilized despite high registration numbers.

3. Insurance Penetration and Growth Potential Analysis

Scenario
PhonePe has ventured into the insurance domain, providing users with options to secure various policies. With increasing transactions in this segment, the company seeks to analyze its growth trajectory and identify untapped opportunities for insurance adoption at the state level. This data will help prioritize regions for marketing efforts and partnerships with insurers.

4. Transaction Analysis for Market Expansion
Scenario
PhonePe operates in a highly competitive market, and understanding transaction dynamics at the state level is crucial for strategic decision-making. With a growing number of transactions across different regions, the company seeks to analyze its transaction data to identify trends, opportunities, and potential areas for expansion.

5. User Engagement and Growth Strategy

Scenario
PhonePe seeks to enhance its market position by analyzing user engagement across different states and districts. With a significant number of registered users and app opens, understanding user behavior can provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making and growth opportunities.



6. Insurance Engagement Analysis
Scenario
PhonePe aims to analyze insurance transactions across various states and districts to understand the uptake of insurance services among users. This analysis will provide insights into user behavior, market demand, and potential areas for growth in insurance offerings.



7. Transaction Analysis Across States and Districts
Scenario
PhonePe is conducting an analysis of transaction data to identify the top-performing states, districts, and pin codes in terms of transaction volume and value. This analysis will help understand user engagement patterns and identify key areas for targeted marketing efforts..

8. User Registration Analysis
Scenario
PhonePe aims to conduct an analysis of user registration data to identify the top states, districts, and pin codes from which the most users registered during a specific year-quarter combination. This analysis will provide insights into user engagement patterns and highlight potential growth areas.

9. Insurance Transactions Analysis
Scenario
PhonePe aims to analyze insurance transactions to identify the top states, districts, and pin codes where the most insurance transactions occurred during a specific year-quarter combination. This analysis will help in understanding user engagement in the insurance sector and informing strategic decisions.
